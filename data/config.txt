# Think of this as a sample configuration file. Before you can parse
# the file, you have to remove blank lines and comment lines. A
# comment line is any line with a "#" as its first non-blank/non-tab
# character. Blank lines are lines with no content or just white space
# content.

You'll end up keeping this line.

You will keep this one, too, but not the one before it.

# This is a comment.
            # So is this.

END
